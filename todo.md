## ⏳ Next Steps & To-Do

### 1. ~~**Build Final Feature Dataset (Evening Task)**~~ ✅ COMPLETED (March 3, 2026)

    - **Priority**: ~~High~~ → Done
    - **Task**: Re-implemented `src/preprocessing/build_features.py`.
    - **Result**: Pipeline produces a unified dataset ready for the modeling phase.

### 2. ~~**Re-run Models with Sentiment Data**~~ ✅ COMPLETED (March 3, 2026)

    - **Priority**: ~~High~~ → Done
    - **Task**: After the feature dataset is built, re-run the `market_modeling.py` and `pytorch_modeling.py` scripts.
    - **Goal**: Analyze the impact of the new sentiment feature on model performance and generate updated results.

### 3. ~~**Develop the Streamlit Dashboard**~~ ✅ COMPLETED (March 8, 2026)

    - **Priority**: ~~Medium~~ → Done
    - **Task**: Begin development of the `Streamlit` dashboard to visualize project outputs.
    - **Initial Features**:
        - ✅ Display the lead-lag dependency graph from the `statsmodels` analysis.
        - ✅ Show the `PyTorch` model's predictions vs. actuals chart.
        - ✅ Create interactive charts for exploring the raw market and macro data, including news sentiment.

## 🗃️ Backlog & Future Enhancements

### 1. Machine Learning Model Improvements

- ~~**Introduce Tree-Based Benchmarks (LightGBM/XGBoost)**~~: ✅ COMPLETED (March 8, 2026). Implemented Gradient Boosting trees as a strong baseline model, framing time-series forecasting as a tabular learning problem.
- **Time-Series Transformers**: Implement a Transformer-based architecture specifically designed for time-series forecasting.
- **Target Engineering (Direction First, Magnitude Second)**: Utilize a two-stage Hurdle Model approach (Classification for direction, Regression for magnitude).

### 2. Dataset & Feature Engineering Improvements

- **Solve News Data Limitation**: Obtain historical news data (2+ years) to better evaluate sentiment impact.
- **Refine Preprocessing & Advanced Indicators**:
  - ~~Implement advanced technical indicators (Momentum, RSI, MACD, Bollinger Bands, ATR) for better short-term signaling.~~ ✅ COMPLETED (March 11, 2026)
  - Explore clustering techniques to group similar assets.

### 3. MLOps & Orchestration

- **Hyperparameter Tuning**: Tune hyperparameters for models using MLflow's tracking capabilities.
- **Orchestration**: Re-evaluate integrating **Prefect** for more robust ETL pipeline orchestration.
