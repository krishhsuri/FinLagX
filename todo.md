    ##   Completed Milestones

    -   [x] **Setup & Infrastructure**: Docker environment with TimescaleDB and MongoDB is fully operational.
    -   [x] **Data Ingestion Pipeline**: Automated scripts for market, macro, and news data collection are in place.
    -   [x] **Data Preprocessing**: Initial data cleaning and alignment pipelines are functional.
    -   [x] **Statistical Modeling**: Implemented `statsmodels` for Granger Causality and VAR analysis.
    -   [x] **Deep Learning Modeling**: Implemented `PyTorch` LSTM for time-series forecasting.
    -   [x] **Experiment Tracking**: Integrated `MLflow` for tracking and visualizing model performance.
    -   [x] **Version Control**: Modeling work has been pushed to the `modelingdev` branch on GitHub.
    -   [x] **Sentiment Analysis**: Implemented `FinBERT` pipeline to generate and store sentiment scores for news articles.

    ## ⏳ Next Steps & To-Do

    ### 1. ~~**Build Final Feature Dataset (Evening Task)**~~ ✅ COMPLETED (March 3, 2026)
        - **Priority**: ~~High~~ → Done
        - **Task**: Re-implemented `src/preprocessing/build_features.py`:
            - ✅ Fetches market data from TimescaleDB (via MarketDataPreprocessor).
            - ✅ Fetches news articles and their FinBERT sentiment scores from MongoDB.
            - ✅ Aggregates daily sentiment (mean, std, min, max, count per category).
            - ✅ Aligns and merges market + sentiment on a daily basis (left join).
            - ✅ Adds derived features (SMA crossover, volatility regime, return sign).
            - ✅ Saves the final feature-rich dataset to `data/processed/market/aligned_market_data.parquet`.
        - **Result**: Pipeline produces a unified dataset ready for the modeling phase.

    ### 2. **Re-run Models with Sentiment Data**
        - **Priority**: High
        - **Task**: After the feature dataset is built, re-run the `market_modeling.py` and `pytorch_modeling.py` scripts.
        - **Goal**: Analyze the impact of the new sentiment feature on model performance and generate updated results (graphs, metrics in MLflow).

    ### 3. **Develop the Streamlit Dashboard**
        - **Priority**: Medium
        - **Task**: Begin development of the `Streamlit` dashboard to visualize project outputs.
        - **Initial Features**:
            - Display the lead-lag dependency graph from the `statsmodels` analysis.
            - Show the `PyTorch` model's predictions vs. actuals chart.
            - Create interactive charts for exploring the raw market and macro data, including news sentiment.

    ##  backlog & Future Enhancements

    -   **Solve News Data Limitation**: The RSS feeds provide limited historical data (~2 years).
        - **Option A**: Integrate a large, pre-existing news dataset from **Kaggle**.
        - **Option B**: Develop a more robust web scraper using `BeautifulSoup` to manually collect historical news archives.
    -   **Refine Preprocessing**:
        - Implement more advanced feature engineering (e.g., volatility metrics, technical indicators).
        - Explore clustering techniques to group similar assets.
    -   **Enhance Modeling**:
        - Experiment with more advanced `PyTorch` models like **Transformers**.
        - Tune hyperparameters for the LSTM model using MLflow's tracking capabilities.
    -   **Orchestration**: Re-evaluate integrating **Prefect** for more robust ETL pipeline orchestration.
