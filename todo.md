    ## ⏳ Next Steps & To-Do

    ### 1. **Build Final Feature Dataset (Evening Task)**
        - **Priority**: High
        - **Task**: Re-implement and run the `src/preprocessing/build_features.py` script to:
            - Fetch market data from TimescaleDB.
            - Fetch news articles and their new sentiment scores from MongoDB.
            - Align and merge these two datasets on a daily basis.
            - Save the final, feature-rich dataset to `data/processed/market/aligned_market_data.parquet`.
        - **Goal**: Create the final, unified dataset required for the modeling phase.

    ### 2. **Re-run Models with Sentiment Data**
        - **Priority**: High
        - **Task**: After the feature dataset is built, re-run the `market_modeling.py` and `pytorch_modeling.py` scripts.
        - **Goal**: Analyze the impact of the new sentiment feature on model performance and generate updated results (graphs, metrics in MLflow).

    ### 3. **Develop the Streamlit Dashboard**
        - **Priority**: Medium
        - **Task**: Begin development of the `Streamlit` dashboard to visualize project outputs.
        - **Initial Features**:
            - Display the lead-lag dependency graph from the `statsmodels` analysis.
            - Show the `PyTorch` model's predictions vs. actuals chart.
            - Create interactive charts for exploring the raw market and macro data, including news sentiment.

    ##  backlog & Future Enhancements

    -   **Solve News Data Limitation**: The RSS feeds provide limited historical data (~2 years).
        - **Option A**: Integrate a large, pre-existing news dataset from **Kaggle**.
        - **Option B**: Develop a more robust web scraper using `BeautifulSoup` to manually collect historical news archives.
    -   **Refine Preprocessing**:
        - Implement more advanced feature engineering (e.g., volatility metrics, technical indicators).
        - Explore clustering techniques to group similar assets.
    -   **Enhance Modeling**:
        - Experiment with more advanced `PyTorch` models like **Transformers**.
        - Tune hyperparameters for the LSTM model using MLflow's tracking capabilities.
    -   **Orchestration**: Re-evaluate integrating **Prefect** for more robust ETL pipeline orchestration.
